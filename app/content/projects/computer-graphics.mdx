# University Graphics Renderer Project

**Note that, as this is a University project, you will need to request access to the repository to view the code.**

This project is a **University project** for a course named "Computer Graphics." It is a 2-person group project, developed by me and **Boris Radulov**, with the goal of building a Graphics Renderer software using OpenGL, GLSL, and IMGui in C++.

The foundation of the project was provided by the University. This included a basic project builder using Premake, essential libraries such as glad, glfw, rapidobj, and glm, and a basic structure for the project. This setup helped us focus on implementing the core features of the renderer.

## Features

This project includes several features that were implemented by us:

- **Camera Movement**: Controlled using keyboard and mouse inputs.
- **Object Animation**: Basic animations for the objects within the scene.
- **Blinn-Phong Lighting Model**: Implemented for realistic lighting and shading.
- **Textures**: Added to objects for more detailed rendering.
- **Texture Mapping**: Applied textures accurately to 3D models.
- **Hierarchical Modelling**: Structured models with parent-child relationships.

For more details, please check the [assignment brief](/content/projects/computer-graphics/assignment-brief.pdf) that we followed. While we did not implement every feature, we successfully incorporated many, achieving a 71% grade.

## Project Structure

The project structure is straightforward, prioritizing feature implementation:

- `main`: Contains the source code.
- `assets`: Includes the models and textures used.
- `third_party` and `support`: Contain external libraries.

## Technologies

The project was written in C++ and utilized multiple libraries to build specific features. The main libraries used were: OpenGL, GLSL, IMGui, glad, glfw, rapidobj, and glm.

## Results

Overall, this was one of my best university projects. Working with Boris and developing software to render 3D objects was a great experience. It was highly educational, and I am pleased with the outcome.

Here are two screenshots of the software in action

## Challenges and Learning

Throughout this project, we encountered several challenges, including optimizing the rendering pipeline and managing memory efficiently. These challenges provided valuable learning experiences in debugging and performance tuning.

## Future Work

Looking forward, a refactoring of the codebase would be beneficial to improve readability and maintainability. Additionally, implementing more advanced features such as shadow mapping and post-processing effects would enhance the renderer's capabilities.
