# Flight Aggregator

This project is a University coursework for a course named "Web Services and Web Data". It is a 12-people group project and it had the scope of building an Flights Aggregator software; therefore we had to split it into multiple subteams:

- one team that builds some APIs for airline companies (3 persons)
- one team that builds APIs for banking systems (3 persons)
- one team that build extra services (3 persons)
- another team that build the actual aggregator (3 persons) in which I was also a part of.

So the next project is intended to aggregate 9 different APIs (as each member had to build a different service). Please also read the PDFs inside the documentation folder for a better understanding of the project.

**Please note that, as this project is old and the other APIs are not available, the project will not work as intended.**

## Team members

Because this is also a group project, I have worked with my team to create the software. The team was composed of:

- Abhishek Paradkar
- Bogdan Ciurea
- Boris Radulov
- Callum Andrew Harrison
- Christian Constantin Pustianu
- Dominika Iwanicka
- Dominik Stark
- Kacper Roemer
- Kristian Ivanov
- Shreyas Honnalli
- Theodora Vraimakis

## Technologies

The project was written in Python and it uses multiple libraries depending on the service each of us had to build.
The main ones that I used were: python-dotenv, requests and rich.

## Documentation

You can read the documentation in the `documentation` folder of the repository. It contains the PDFs that were submitted for the project with all the necessary information.

## Results

Overall, this was one of my best projects in University. It was a great experience to work with so many people and to build a software that aggregates multiple services. It was a great learning experience and I am happy with the results.

When it comes to the actual result, here is a screenshot of the software running:
