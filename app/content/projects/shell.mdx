# My Shell

The next program is intended to simulate a terminal/command shell in the [XV6](https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-riscv) Operating System.
This program was written for a coursework from University.

## How to use

In order to use the code you will have to `git clone https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-riscv` on your local machine.
In the Makefile add the following code on line 130: `$U/_mysh\` .
Then run `make`, `make qemu`. After the files have been compiled the terminal should display the next text:
`hart 2 starting`
`hart 1 starting`
`init: starting sh`
`$`
After this just type `mysh` and the program will run. When the program runs, the shell should show the next characters: `>>>`.

## Usable commands

The program can process more types of commands like:

- simple commands: `ls`, `echo hello`, `wc hello world`, `cd file` or `mkdir file`;
- Input / output redirections: `echo hello > foo` or `cat < foo`;
- Pipes: `ls | wc` or `echo hello world | wc`;
- Multi element pipes: `ls | wc | wc` or `echo hello world | wc | wc`;
- Non-trivial combinations of pipes and redirection: `ls | wc | wc > foo` (the code will not be able to read from a file and only write to one);
- `;` between the commands will make more commands from a line

## Disclaimer

The following code is only usable in a XV6 machine although the code is written in a simple type of C.
Not sure if the program can run in normal C on another machine.
