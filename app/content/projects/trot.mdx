# Trot: University Scooter Sharing Software Project

**Note that, as this is a University project, you will need to request access to the repository to view the code.**

This project is a University coursework for a course named "Software Engineering." It is a 7-person group project focused on building a Scooter Sharing software. This project marked our first experience working on a fully-fledged frontend-backend system, with each team member taking on specific roles. I was responsible for the database and backend architecture, mailing systems, various smaller features, and unit testing.

## Features

This project includes several features implemented by our team:

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration for users.
- **Scooter Booking**: Allows users to book scooters for a specified duration.
- **Payment System**: Integrated for secure financial transactions.
- **Mailing System**: Sends notifications and updates to users via email.
- **Admin Panel**: Provides administrative control for managing users and scooters.
- **Unit Testing**: Ensures the reliability of backend functions.

For more details, please check the [assignment brief](/content/projects/trot/project-briefing.pdf) that we followed. While we did not implement every feature, we successfully incorporated many, achieving a 77% grade.

## Technologies

The project was written in Python and utilized multiple libraries to build specific features. The main libraries used were:

- **Flask**: For web framework.
- **Flask-Mail**: For email handling.
- **Flask-RESTful**: For building REST APIs.
- **Flask-SQLAlchemy**: For database management.
- **Flask-Testing**: For unit testing.

The frontend was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. For the database, we used SQLite. To facilitate easier deployment, we utilized Docker/Docker-Compose and a Bash script to streamline the setup process.

## Results

Overall, the project was a success, earning us a 77% final grade. Working with a diverse team on this project highlighted the importance of communication and collaboration. It was an invaluable learning experience in both technical and interpersonal skills.

## Challenges and Learning

Throughout the project, we faced several challenges, such as integrating the payment system securely and ensuring smooth communication between frontend and backend. These challenges taught us a lot about debugging, secure coding practices, and the importance of thorough testing.
