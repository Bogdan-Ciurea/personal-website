# Tomeo Video Player

This project is a **university project** that I have worked on with my team. The idea was to create a video player using the Qt framework in C++.

Because this is also a group project, I have worked with my team to create the software. The team was composed of:

- Alejandro Bertinelli Salamero
- Bogdan Ciurea
- Gabriel Gheorghe
- Christian Constantin Pustianu
- Boris Radulov

# The software

The software product has the following features as requested by the university:

- Video import
- Play/Pause video
- Go to next/previous video
- Volume control
- Gallery view of all the videos
- Metadata editing (title, author, description, geolocation, etc.)
- Trip (aka. playlist) creation or addition of a video to a trip
- Map of the geolocation of the video
- Highlights creation on desired timestamps of the video
- Help menu
- Different language support

There is also a DEMO video that you can watch:

## Used software

The presented software has been made using:

- C++
- Qt framework
- lots of YouTube videos ðŸ˜…

## About the development process

This project has been one of the most organised projects especially because the marking required a lot of documentation and a lot of planning.
Because of this, the project was divided into 5 development cycles:

1. Navigation bar and Import button
2. Partially finished player with tabs at the bottom
3. Map and finished player
4. Trips and Highlights
5. Design overhaul, help section and languages

Because of this the project had a lot of planning and a lot of documentation that was required to be done in order to get a good mark.

For example, especially because this was a USER INTERFACES module, we had to create a lot of mockups of the intended design before we started coding.
For example these are some of the mockups that we have created:
